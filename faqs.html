        delivered from Seller to the Buyer. Escrow bot only releases the funds
        once the Buyer has received and accepted the goods and/or services.

      <p>
        Escrow Bot ensures Sellers are paid when they deliver goods or complete
        agreed upon services, ensuring Buyers receive a refund if goods are not
        delivered or services rendered. Escrow Bot also vets Buyers and Sellers

      <h3>
        If I have any questions about the product, do I contact Escrow Bot?
      </h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        We highly recommend all Buyers reach out directly to their Sellers to
        find out more about the products and/or services being exchanged in
        their transactions. It is critical for both parties to agree upon the
        precise description of that being sold or rendered. If there are any
        questions about any element of the transaction, this should be clarified
        at the commencement of any transaction.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The product should be clearly defined in the “Description” section of
        the transaction, and both the Buyer and Seller must agree on all aspects
        of the transaction, including the “Description” section at the inception
        of a transaction.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Additionally, once the Buyer receives the products and/or services, the
        Inspection Period becomes critical to ensure the products and/or
        services are exactly those listed in the “Description” or agreement. If
        the product and/or service is not what was agreed upon at the inception
        of the transaction, the Buyer has the opportunity to return or reject
        the products and/or services before the Inspection Period which is 1-5
        days after receive expires. login and digital goods are not eligible for
        long inspection period
      </p>
